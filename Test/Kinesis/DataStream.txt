NO.78 A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. 
The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. 
The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions 
with several other internal applications 
Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data 
before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB 
Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction upon write
Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications

B. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose 
to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3 
Use AWS Lambda integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data.
Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3

C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams 
Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction 
and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB 
Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.

D. Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. 
Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive data before updating the files in Amazon S3 
The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB 
Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.
