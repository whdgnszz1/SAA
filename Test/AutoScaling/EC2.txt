NO.40 A company is launching an application on AWS. 
The application uses an Application Load (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group.
The instances are in an Auto Scaling group for each environment. 
The company requires a development and a production environment. 
The production environment will have periods of high traffic.
Which solution will configure the development environment MOST cost-effectively?

A. Reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have one EC2 instance as a target.
B. Change the ALB balancing algorithm to least outstanding requests.
C. Reduce the size of the EC2 instances in both environments.
D. Reduce the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environment's Auto Scaling group

Answer: D
Explanation:
This option will configure the development environment in the most cost-effective way 
as it reduces the number of instances running in the development environment and 
therefore reduces the cost of running the application. 
The development environment typically requires less resources than the production environment, 
and it is unlikely that the development environment will have periods of high traffic 
that would require a large number of instances. 
By reducing the maximum number of instances in the development environment's Auto Scaling group, 
the company can save on costs while still maintaining a functional development environment.
