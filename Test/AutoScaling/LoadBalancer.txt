NO.122 A company's web application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud recently increased in popularity. 
The web application currently exists on a single Amazon EC2 instance in a single public subnet. 
The web application has not been able to meet the demand of the increased web traffic.
The company needs a solution that will provide high availability and scalability 
to meet the increased user demand without rewriting the web application.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

A. Replace the EC2 instance with a larger compute optimized instance.
B. Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with multiple Availability Zones in private subnets.
C. Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet to handle web requests.
D. Replace the EC2 instance with a larger memory optimized instance.
E. Configure an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet to distribute web traffic

Answer: B E

Explanation:
These two steps will meet the requirements because they will provide high availability and scalability 
for the web application without rewriting it. 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in demand. 
By configuring Auto Scaling with multiple Availability Zones in private subnets, 
you can ensure that your web application is distributed across isolated and fault-tolerant locations, 
and that your instances are not directly exposed to the internet. 
An Application Load Balancer operates at the application layer and distributes incoming web traffic across multiple targets, 
such as EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions. 

By configuring an Application Load Balancer in a public subnet, 
you can enable your web application to handle requests from the internet 
and route them to the appropriate targets in the private subnets.
