NO.88 A company wants to experiment with individual AWS accounts for its engineer team. 
The company wants to be notified as soon as the Amazon EC2 instance usage 
for a given month exceeds a specific threshold for each account.
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement MOST cost-effectively?

A. Use Cost Explorer to create a daily report of costs by service. 
Filter the report by EC2 instances. 
Configure Cost Explorer to send an Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) notification when a threshold is exceeded.

B. Use Cost Explorer to create a monthly report of costs by service. 
Filter the report by EC2 instances. 
Configure Cost Explorer to send an Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) notification when a threshold is exceeded.

C. Use AWS Budgets to create a cost budget for each account. 
Set the period to monthly. 
Set the scope to EC2 instances. Set an alert threshold for the budget. 
Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification when a threshold is exceeded.

D. Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report with hourly granularity. 
Integrate the report data with Amazon Athena. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule an Athena query. 
Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification when a threshold is exceeded.

Answer: C
Explanation:
AWS Budgets allows you to create budgets for your AWS accounts and set alerts 
when usage exceeds a certain threshold. 

By creating a budget for each account, specifying the period as monthly and the scope as EC2 instances, 
you can effectively track the EC2 usage for each account and be notified when a threshold is exceeded. 

This solution is the most cost-effective option as it does not require additional resources 
such as Amazon Athena or Amazon EventBridge.
