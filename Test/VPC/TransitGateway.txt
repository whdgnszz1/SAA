NO.118 A company needs to connect several VPCs in the us-east-1 Region that span hundreds of AWS accounts. 
The company's networking team has its own AWS account to manage the cloud network.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution to connect the VPCs?

A. Set up VPC peering connections between each VPC. Update each associated subnet's route table. 
B. Configure a NAT gateway and an internet gateway in each VPC to connect each VPC through the internet.
C. Create an AWS Transit Gateway in the networking team's AWS account. Configure static routes from each VPC.
D. Deploy VPN gateways in each VPC. Create a transit VPC in the networking team's AWS account to connect to each VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Transit Gateway is a highly scalable and centralized hub for 
connecting multiple VPCs, on- premises networks, and remote networks. 
It simplifies network connectivity by providing a single entry point and reducing the number of connections required. 
In this scenario, deploying an AWS Transit Gateway in the networking team's AWS account 
allows for efficient management and control over the network connectivity across multiple VPCs.
