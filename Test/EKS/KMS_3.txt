C. Implement an AWS Lambda tuncuon to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
D. use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

Answer: B
Explanation:
it allows the company to encrypt the Kubernetes secrets object
