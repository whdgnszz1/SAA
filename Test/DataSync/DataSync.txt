Answer: B
Explanation:
it allows the company to migrate its data from the on-premises location to an Amazon S3 bucket 
and automatically validate the integrity of the data after the transfer. 
By deploying an AWS DataSync agent on premises, the company can use a fully managed data transfer service 
that makes it easy to move large amounts of data to and from AWS. 

By configuring the DataSync agent to perform the online data transfer to an S3 bucket, 
the company can take advantage of DataSync's features, such as encryption, compression, bandwidth throttling, and data validation. 
DataSync automatically verifies data integrity at both source and destination after each transfer task.
