NO.54 A company needs to store data from its healthcare application. 
The application's data frequently changes. 
A new regulation requires audit z access at all levels of the stored data.
The company hosts the application on an on-premises infrastructure that is running out of storage capacity. 
A solutions architect must securely migrate the existing data to AWS while satisfying the new regulation.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS DataSync to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log data events.
B. Use AWS Snowcone to move the existing data to Amazon $3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log management events.
C. Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log data events.
D. Use AWS Storage Gateway to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log management events.

Answer: A
Explanation:
This answer is correct because it meets the requirements of securely migrating the existing data to AWS 
and satisfying the new regulation. 
AWS DataSync is a service that makes it easy to move large amounts of data online 
between on-premises storage and Amazon S3. 
DataSync automatically encrypts data in transit and verifies data integrity during transfer. 

AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls for your account 
and delivers log files to Amazon S3. CloudTrail can log data events, 
which show the resource operations performed on or within a resource in your AWS account, 
such as S3 object-level API activity. 
By using CloudTrail to log data events, you can audit access at all levels of the stored data.
