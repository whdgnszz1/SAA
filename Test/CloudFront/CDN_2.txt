NO.95 A company hosts a multi-tier web application on Amazon Linux Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. 
The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones.
The company observes that the Auto Scaling group launches more On-Demand Instances 
when the application's end users access high volumes of static web content. The company wants to optimize cost.
What should a solutions architect do to redesign the application MOST cost-effectively?

A. Update the Auto Scaling group to use Reserved Instances instead of On-Demand Instances.
B. Update the Auto Scaling group to scale by launching Spot Instances instead of On-Demand Instances.
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to host the static web contents from an Amazon S3 bucket.
D. Create an AWS Lambda function behind an Amazon API Gateway API to host the static website contents.

Answer: C
Explanation:
This answer is correct because it meets the requirements of optimizing cost and reducing the workload on the database. 
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service 
that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. 
CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. 

When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, 
the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), 
so that content is delivered with the best possible performance. 

You can create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to host the static web contents from an Amazon S3 bucket, 
which is an origin that you define for CloudFront. 

This way, you can offload the requests for static web content from your EC2 instances to CloudFront, 
which can improve the performance and availability of your website, 
and reduce the cost of running your EC2 instances.
