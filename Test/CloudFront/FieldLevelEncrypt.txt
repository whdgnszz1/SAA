NO.74 A solutions architect is creating a new Amazon CloudFront distribution for an application. 
Some of the information submitted by users is sensitive. 
The application uses HTTPS but needs another layer of security.
The sensitive information should be protected throughout the entire application stack, 
and access to the information should be restricted to certain applications.
Which action should the solutions architect take? 

A. Configure a CloudFront signed URL.
B. Configure a CloudFront signed cookie.
C. Configure a CloudFront field-level encryption profile.
D. Configure CloudFront and set the Origin Protocol Policy setting to HTTPS Only for the Viewer Protocol Policy.

Answer: C
Explanation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/field-level- encryption.html
"With Amazon CloudFront, you can enforce secure end-to-end connections to origin servers by using HTTPS.
Field-level encryption adds an additional layer of security 
that lets you protect specific data throughout system processing so that only certain applications can see it."
