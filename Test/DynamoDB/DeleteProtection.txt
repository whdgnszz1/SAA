NO.108 A company stores critical data in Amazon DynamoDB tables in the company's AWS account.
An IT administrator accidentally deleted a DynamoDB table.
The deletion caused a significant loss of data and disrupted the company's operations.
The company wants to prevent this type of disruption in the future.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Configure a trail in AWS CloudTrail.
Create an Amazon EventBridge rule for delete actions.
Create an AWS Lambda function to automatically restore deleted DynamoDB tables.

B. Create a backup and restore plan for the DynamoDB tables.
Recover the DynamoDB tables manually.

C. Configure deletion protection on the DynamoDB tables.

D. Enable point-in-time recovery on the DynamoDB tables.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Deletion protection is a feature of DynamoDB that prevents accidental deletion of tables.
When deletion protection is enabled, you cannot delete a table unless you explicitly disable it first.
This adds an extra layer of security and reduces the risk of data loss and operational disruption.
Deletion protection is easy to enable and disable using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the DynamoDB API.
This solution has the least operational overhead,
as you do not need to create, manage, or invoke any additional resources or services.
