NO.66 A company is using a centralized AWS account to store log data in various Amazon S3 buckets. 
A solutions architect needs to ensure that the data is encrypted at rest before the data is uploaded to the S3 buckets. 
The data also must be encrypted in transit.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Use client-side encryption to encrypt the data that is being uploaded to the S3 buckets.
B. Use server-side encryption to encrypt the data that is being uploaded to the S3 buckets.
C. Create bucket policies that require the use of server-side encryption with S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) for S3 uploads.
D. Enable the security option to encrypt the S3 buckets through the use of a default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.

Answer: A
Explanation:
Client-side encryption is a method of encrypting data before uploading it to Amazon S3. 
It allows users to manage the encryption process, encryption keys, and related tools. 
By using client-side encryption, the solution can ensure that the data is encrypted at rest and in transit, 
as Amazon S3 will not have access to the encryption keys or the unencrypted data.
