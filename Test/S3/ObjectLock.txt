NO.71 A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. 
The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable 
for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. 
Only specific users in the company's AWS account can have the ability to delete the objects. 
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an S3 Glacier vault Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects 
B. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled 
Enable versioning Set a retention period of 100 years 
Use governance mode as the S3 bucket's default retention mode for new objects
C. Create an S3 bucket Use AWS CloudTrail to rack any S3 API events that modify the objects Upon notification, 
restore the modified objects from any backup versions that the company has
D. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled 
Enable versioning Add a legal hold to the objects 
Add the s3 PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects

Answer: D
Explanation:
"The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. 
Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. 
However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed."
