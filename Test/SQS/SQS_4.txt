NO.109 A company is designing an application. 
The application uses an AWS Lambda function 
to receive information through Amazon API Gateway 
and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.
During the proof-of-concept stage, 
the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly 
to handle the high volumes of data 
that the company needs to load into the database. 
A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability 
and minimize the configuration effort. 
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Refactor the Lambda function code to Apache Tomcat code that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. 
Connect the database by using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers.

B. Change the platform from Aurora to Amazon DynamoDB. 
Provision a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. 
Use the DAX client SDK to point the existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster. 

C. Set up two Lambda functions. 
Configure one function to receive the information. 
Configure the other function to load the information into the database. 
Integrate the Lambda functions by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

D. Set up two Lambda functions. 
Configure one function to receive the information. 
Configure the other function to load the information into the database. 
Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. 

Answer: D

Explanation:
bottlenecks can be avoided with queues (SQS).
