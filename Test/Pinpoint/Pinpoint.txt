Receive SMS messages from your customers and reply back to them in a chat-like interactive experience. 
With Amazon Pinpoint, you can create automatic responses when customers send you messages that contain certain keywords. 
You can even use Amazon Lex to create conversational bots. 
A majority of mobile phone users read incoming SMS messages almost immediately after receiving them. 
If you need to be able to provide your customers with urgent or important information, 
SMS messaging may be the right solution for you. 
You can use Amazon Pinpoint to create targeted groups of customers, 
and then send them campaign-based messages. 

You can also use Amazon Pinpoint to send direct messages, 
such as appointment confirmations, order updates, and one-time passwords.
