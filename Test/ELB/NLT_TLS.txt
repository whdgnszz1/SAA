NO.63 A company has a three-tier application on AWS that ingests sensor data 
from its users' devices The traffic flows through a Network Load Balancer (NLB) 
then to Amazon EC2 instances for the web tier and finally to EC2 instances for the application tier 
The application tier makes calls to a database 
What should a solutions architect do to improve the security of the data in transit?

A. Configure a TLS listener Deploy the server certrficate on the NLB
B. Configure AWS Shield Advanced Enable AWS WAF on the NLB
C. Change the load balancer to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) Enable AWS WAF on the ALB
D. Encrypt the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instances by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)

Answer: A
Explanation:
The best option to improve the security of the data in transit is 
to configure a TLS listener and deploy the server certificate on the NLB. 
This will ensure that the data is encrypted and secure as it travels through the network. 
Additionally, you could also configure AWS Shield Advanced and enable AWS WAF on the NLB 
to further protect the network from malicious attacks. 

Alternatively, you could also change the load balancer to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) 
and enable AWS WAF on the ALB. 

Finally, you could also encrypt the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume 
on the EC2 instances by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

You must specify an SSL certificate for a TLS listener. 
The load balancer uses the certificate to terminate the connection 
and decrypt requests from clients before routing them to targets.
